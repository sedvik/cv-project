# cv-project
This is an implementation of The Odin Project CV Application project. 

## Purpose
This project was completed in order to practice the following:

1. Application development using React
2. Use of React state and props
3. Separating an application into relatively small (sometimes reusable) components 
4. create-react-app use and deployment practice

## Application Details
This application allows a user to input resume information into 3 main sections:

1. Contact Information
2. Education
3. Experience

At any point in time when filling out the associated fields the submit button can be pressed to show a "Display" version of the resume.
Once the "Display" version is active, the edit button can be clicked to resume editing.
As many Education and Experience entries, as well as experience Tasks can be added/removed as desired.
